# Designated Survivor

The world of Spee has been ravaged by the Invasion of Darkness and the subsequent zombie apocalypse.
A post-apocalyptic First-Person Shooter and Racing game taking place on Spee in the present day.
In a world were the apocalypse just happened the other day, you have to fight for resources.
In this world you race and fight for food, if you win you win for your division. (there is also outside conflict and stuff)
(I just want to be able to get the two ideas to work)
## FPS and Racing
Following the trail of destruction, you will be tasked with defending yourself against raiders and zombies as well as competing with racers for supplies. Choose from the resources left behind by the Maplibamian military and the cars left behind by the citizens. 
## To-Dos
