A post-apocalyptic First-Person Shooter and Racing game taking place on Spee in the present day.
In a world were the apocalypse just happened the other day, you have to fight for resources.
In this world you race and fight for food, if you win you win for your division. (there is also outside conflict and stuff)
(I just want to be able to get the two ideas to work)
